#+TITLE: Import Textmate bundles into Emacs using lisp
#+AUTHOR: Matthew L. Fidler

This library allows you to import TextMate bundle snippets to
Yasnippet

To use, put in a directory in the load path, like ~/elisp and put
the following in ~/.emacs

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp :results silent
(require 'textmate-to-yas)
#+END_SRC

If you wish to use a snippet from GitHub, just drag the .tar.gz
file to emacs while Yasnippet is running
